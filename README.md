## Abstract
This project solves exemplarily (because several ways lead to the goal) exercise 1 from the programming practical course in the winter semester 2022 / 2023.
Since the data - despite XML and DTD of the German Bundestag - is not ideally represented, importing is not trivial.

At the same time, this is also a reality of life, as there is no such thing as perfect data, and it usually always contains errors.

We address this problem in a later exercise.

## Usage
To use the program it is necessary to insert the speeches of the German Bundestag as a path.
The master data of the MPs can also be specified; if not, they will be downloaded live.

## Questions
Feel free to ask questions in the tutorials.
